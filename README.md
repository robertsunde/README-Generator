## Installation <br/>
In order to install the needed node packages the command "npm install" must be entered in the terminal while the index.js file is selected. This will allow for the program to execute. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
## Usage <br/>
Enter usage details here. After following the installation instructions, enter "node index.js" into the terminal while the file is selected. Next, follow the prompts and answer as directed. Once finished, this will generate a README file within the current folder. The file will be pre-formatted and ready to use. <br/>
